                    <br>
                    <p>Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Every computer that is connected to the Internet is part of a network, even the one in your home. For example, you may use a modem and dial a local number to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). At work, you may be part of a local area network (LAN), but you most likely still connect to the Internet using an ISP that your company has contracted with. When you connect to your ISP, you become part of their network. The ISP may then connect to a larger network and become part of their network. The Internet is simply a network of networks.</p>
                    <p>Most large communications companies have their own dedicated backbones connecting various regions. In each region, the company has a Point of Presence (POP). The POP is a place for local users to access the company's network, often through a local phone number or dedicated line. The amazing thing here is that there is no overall controlling network. Instead, there are several high-level networks connecting to each other through Network Access Points or NAPs.</p>

                    <h2> What is an IP Address?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Every machine on the Internet has a unique identifying number, called an <b>IP Address</b>. The IP stands for <b>Internet Protocol</b>, which is the language that computers use to communicate over the Internet. A protocol is the pre-defined way that someone who wants to use a service talks with that service. The &quot;someone&quot; could be a person, but more often it is a computer program like a Web browser.</p>
                    <p>A typical IP address looks like this: 216.27.61.137.</p>
                    <p>To make it easier for us humans to remember, IP addresses are normally expressed in decimal format as a <i>dotted decimal number</i> like the one above. But computers communicate in <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bytes.htm">binary</a> form. Look at the same IP address in binary: 11011000.00011011.00111101.10001001.</p>
                    <p>The four numbers in an IP address are called <b>octets</b>, because they each have eight positions when viewed in binary form. If you add all the positions together, you get 32, which is why IP addresses are considered 32-bit numbers. Since each of the eight positions can have two different states (1 or zero), the total number of possible combinations per octet is 2<sup>8</sup> or 256. So each octet can contain any value between zero and 255. Combine the four octets and you get 2<sup>32</sup> or a possible 4,294,967,296 unique values!</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>There are two standards for IP addresses: IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6). All computers with IP addresses have an IPv4 address, and many are starting to use the new IPv6 address system as well. Here's what these two address types mean:</p>

                    <p>IPv4 uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv4 address is expressed by four numbers separated by dots. Each number is the decimal (base-10) representation for an eight-digit binary (base-2) number, also called an octet. For example: 216.27.61.137</p>
                    <p>IPv6 uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv6 address is expressed by eight groups of hexadecimal (base-16) numbers separated by colons, as in 2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652. Groups of numbers that contain all zeros are often omitted to save space, leaving a colon separator to mark the gap (as in 2001:cdba::3257:9652). </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>When the Internet was in its infancy, it consisted of a small number of computers hooked together with modems and telephone lines. You could only make connections by providing the IP address of the computer you wanted to establish a link with. For example, a typical IP address might be 216.27.22.162. This was fine when there were only a few hosts out there, but it became unwieldy as more and more systems came online.</p>
                    <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tz64HbH4pPQ/V3y-kzLw8xI/AAAAAAAAAVM/CXNWymh5UxcGbD6h2VIw4mJSD3p9g79zACLcB/s1600/What%2Bis%2BDomain%2BName%2BServer%2Band%2BHow%2BDoes%2Bit%2BWork.png">
                    <p>The first solution to the problem was a simple text file maintained by the Network Information Center that mapped names to IP addresses. Soon this text file became so large it was too cumbersome to manage. In 1983, the University of Wisconsin created the <b>Domain Name System</b> (DNS), which maps text names to IP addresses automatically. This way you only need to remember <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/">www.howstuffworks.com</a>, for example, instead of HowStuffWorks.com's IP address.</p>
